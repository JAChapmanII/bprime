Figure out which numbers are prime, up to some large number. Uses the Sieve of
Eratosthene's, but I believe it is some extenision of it, looking at the
calculation of MEM_REQUIREMENT, I would say the 1st extension which is stored
in bit-packed bytes.

Building:
	make

Running:
	./bprime

	Or,
		./bprime <num>
	determines primality of all integers up to num^2
